Rationale for this structure
Monorepo for a single, logical project
Centralized management: Keeping the frontend and backend in one repository simplifies versioning and dependency management for a tightly coupled app.
Decoupled code: While together, the backend/ and frontend/ folders are developed and built independently. A Go server can serve the React build artifacts, or you can serve them from a CDN. 
Go backend (backend/)
Standard layout: The structure follows the standard Go project layout, which is highly maintainable and widely recognized within the Go community.
cmd/: Contains the main entry points for different applications. A microservices architecture could include multiple folders here, like cmd/api and cmd/worker.
internal/: Houses private application code that other modules should not import. This includes handlers, business logic, and database access.
pkg/: Contains code intended for use by external applications or shared functionality across different services.
Separation of concerns: This layout enforces a clear separation of concerns, making the backend easier to understand, test, and scale. 
React frontend (frontend/)
Standard Vite layout: The structure is based on a standard Vite setup, which is minimal and efficient by default.
Feature-based organization: Rather than grouping files by type (components/, hooks/), this structure groups them by feature (features/). This co-locates all code relevant to a specific feature, improving scalability and maintainability as the project grows.
Logical separation: Folders like components/ are reserved for truly reusable UI components, while feature-specific components live within their respective features/ directory.
services/: A dedicated place for API clients, data fetching logic, or other external service integrations. 
Deployment with Docker
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml provide a clear path for production deployment.
Multi-stage builds: For the Dockerfile, a multi-stage build is ideal. It first builds the React static files and then serves them using the Go binary, resulting in a single, optimized production image.
